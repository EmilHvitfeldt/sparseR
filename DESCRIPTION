Description: 
    This package is designed to implement ranked sparsity methods, including 
    penalized regression methods such as the sparsity-ranked lasso, MCP, SCAD,
    and elastic net, as well as the sparsity-ranked Bayesian Information 
    Criterion (RBIC). These methods are primarily useful for variable selection
    in the presence of prior informational asymmetry, which occurs in the 
    context of trying to perform variable selection in the presence of interactions
    and/or polynomials. Ultimately, this package attempts to facilitate  
    dealing with cumbersome interactions and polynomials while not avoiding them
    entirely.
