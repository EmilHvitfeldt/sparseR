The package implements the following ranked sparsity methods:

1) Sparsity-ranked lasso
2) Sparsity-ranked MCP
3) Sparsity-ranked SCAD
4) Ranked Bayesian Information Criterion (and corresponding stepwise approaches)

Additionally, `sparseR` has many features designed to streamline dealing with interaction terms and polynomials, including functions for variable pre-processing, variable selection, post-selection inference, and post-fit model visualization under ranked sparsity.

The package is currently in beta phase (version 0.0.1), with plans for a stable release to CRAN in February 2022. A publication detailing ranked sparsity principles is currently under review, and available upon request.
